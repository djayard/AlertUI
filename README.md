# AlertUI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4.

This is a quick implementation of an UI that supports filtering on some data.

## How to Quickly Experience This App

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed already, also make sure to have the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) installed.

```

Once the CLI is installed, execute `ng serve --open` to have the app load in your default browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
